# LPIS

This project was developed for my Language Processing course. This program compiles a simple imperative language to a stack-based VM code. Flex and Yacc were used to develop the compiler.

An example of the features of the language can be found in the samples folder.

## Usage

`make`

`./lpisc -o program < samples/src/cicles.lpis`
